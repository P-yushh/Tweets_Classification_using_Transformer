# Tweets Classification using Transformer

## Description
First project in the field of Natural Language Processing. It is based on Text Classification. Theoretically learned about different text prerocessing steps and models. Practically, used Bert based Transformer for classification.

## Problem Statment
Classify Disaster Tweets as real or fake to predict real disasters.

## Knowledge Gained
1. Learnt about basic NLP topics like tokenization, lemmitization, stemming, bag of words.
2. Text preprocessing and cleaning.
3. Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), Long Short Term Memory(LSTM), Attention mechanism and Transformers.
